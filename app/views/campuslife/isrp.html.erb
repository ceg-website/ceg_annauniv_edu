					<p align="justify" class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">Social responsibility is one of the mainstays that support our academic and research work at CEG, and it is also one of our strategic priorities, as we believe that our role as an engineering institution involves something more than simply the imparting of knowledge and skills to our students and, as active agents of social change, we aim to address and find solutions to social problems. This responsibility implies taking on the role of leader in the creation of a culture of social responsibility in society through our own example and action, and we are committed to defending the ideals, responsibilities and objectives of a socially responsible academic institution.</p>
