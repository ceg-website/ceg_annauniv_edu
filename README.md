# CEG Site


Ceg.annauniv.edu website ! 

We started developing the ceg.annauniv.edu website in ruby on rails, the current repo contains the working version of the website, which we hosted for a few days in the offical domain ceg.annauniv.edu, due to few factors then the backend of this website was shifted and re coded in PHP, maintaining the same design. There are issues in this ror version though. Feel free to use this as a starting point in case you are going to take up and do some changes for the ceg.annauniv.edu website in the future. 

This repo is no longer maintained.
